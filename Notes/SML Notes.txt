================= Syntax ====================

:: Static Environment 

:: Something like a varibable but not quite called a 'Binding' 
:: Stored like | x | 10 | int | 
::Type can be inferred 
val x = 10; 

:: Binding example, can specify type 
val x = 10:int;

:: Stored as 
:: | y | 20 | int | 
:: | f | int->int | 
:: | y | 30 | int | 

:: Inside of f, a is defined 
:: Which 'y' will be used in the function? 
:: At time a the function there | y | 20 | int |  exists which will be the one used in the function 
:: So | y | 20 | int | will be used in the function 
:: After the second y is defined, the old y cannot be accessed outside the function

val y = 20;
fun f a = a + y; 
val y = 10 + y;

:: Sometimes compiler can optimize unused code
:: Must be a unused Binding
:: Must be a pure function if a function is involved 
:: Pure functions will be defined more later

::Functions only have a single expression 

================= Sematics ====================

:: Cannot mix types 
:: Ex. int + float, 1 + 1.0
